					<h2> Baha’i Temples: A Brief Introduction</h2>
						<p>
							Baha’i Houses of Worship (or temples, as they often called) are places of prayer built by Baha’is, but open to people of all faiths, religions and beliefs. In the Baha’i Writings, they are also referred to as Mashriqu’l-Adhkar, which is Arabic for “The Dawning Place of the Mention of God”, and they are not simply buildings, but are considered sacred institutions.
						</p>
						<p>
							Baha’i temples can be built in any way, and with any materials. The structural requirements of all Baha’i temples are that they have a dome, are round and have nine sides. The sides are symbolic of the essential unity underpinning the great religions of the world.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Baha’i Houses of worship have a great impact on tourism because of the fact that they are open to anyone from any religion or background. It is free to visit and is open for everyone to share a quiet but beautiful space to pray and to meditate. It brings a lot of revenue to all things associated with tourism/ its industry but brings no funds from people other than Baha’is free to visit and open to everyone.
